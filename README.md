# Design
Gearworks is literally just a spark in my head at the moment, but I still have some core ideas.

## Aesthetics
It has to look good. Textures must all work together and be unified. If a clockpunk fan would love it, its good in my eyes. Hopefully, an animation API can be used to make the gears, etc. move fluidly.

## Mechanics
 * This will likely be made as a Tinkers Construct Expansion, using the smeltery to craft the gears.
 * Gears have different sizes, determined by the size of their mold
 * The Tinkers construct smeltery will be used to pour materials into the mold
 * All recipies should be recyclable. Metals can be smelted with some loss, wood can be burnt, stone can be broken down into cobblestone or gravel
 * Power can be brought into motors using RF. Power can be made into RF using dynamos. 
 * Stronger materials have more durability, but other drawbacks like the effort and complexity of their crafting. 
     * Golden Gears can carry redstone signal, but break at high speeds
     * Iron Gears move quickly and last long, but are difficult to craft
     * Wooden gears are cheap, but can only move at low speeds and break quickly
     * etc.
 * Pendulums can be used to generate momentum/power, walking into their block starts them swinging.
 * Possible compatibility with other mods
     * Thaumcraft (Golems)
     * Immersive Engineering, Ancient Warfare (Windmills, Waterwheels, etc.)
     * Botania (Mystical Motors)
