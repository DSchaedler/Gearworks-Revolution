# Design
Gearworks is literally just a spark in my head at the moment, but I still have some core ideas.

## Aesthetics
It has to look good. Textures must all work together and be unified. If a clockpunk fan would love it, its good in my eyes.

## Mechanics
In no particular order:
 * Gear teeth should have different sizes, configuarable when being built. Different sizes are incompatible and have to be scaled using a drive shaft
 * All recipies should be recyclable. Im sick of having chests full of things Ill never need.
 * Power generation should be limited to sources like windmills, water wheels and coal ovens. No RF or other power systems allowed. If you are actively, rather than passively generating energy, it is more effective.
 * All recipies should be done with vanilla materials. Changing worldgen is inconvenient and unnecissary with the proper imagination.
 * No reliance on other mods (unless absolutely necessary). This should be a self-contained package.
 * Stronger materials have more durability, but other drawbacks like the effort and complexity of their crafting.
